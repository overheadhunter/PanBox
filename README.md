## About PanBox

PanBox- Transparent Encryption of Files and Folders for Cloud and Storage

+ Store files to the PanBox-Folder
+ Files are encrypted and stored to the cloud
+ Protects confidentiality and integrity of data
+ Secure sharing of date between users and devices

Cloud storage is very popular due to ease of use, cheap prices and fast internet connection. The market leader Dropbox alone has more than 300 million users. However, the security of the data, which is put to the cloud storage, is threatened by the processing within the cloud storage itself, by cyber-attacks or by intelligence surveillance. A solution to this problem is provided by the software PanBox. It extends cloud-storage with client-side end-to-end encryption of data. By its unique decentralized key management PanBox still allows convenient sharing of data with other users among various devices. The user maintains complete control of the encryption and all the necessary keys.
